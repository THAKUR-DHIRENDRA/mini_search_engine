Data is the fuel that powers modern software development. Without data, a search engine has nothing to index. We organize data into various structures to make retrieval faster. Big data requires specialized processing techniques to handle the load. Every piece of data in our file system is indexed by its content. We clean the data by removing punctuation and converting to lowercase. Storing data efficiently is a key challenge in software engineering projects.
