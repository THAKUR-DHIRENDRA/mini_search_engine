Computer science bridges the gap between hardware and software. While software provides the logic, the hardware provides the power. Understanding how an algorithm interacts with memory is vital for performance. Every student must learn how coded instructions are executed by the CPU. At KIET, we explore both the abstract programs and the physical hardware.
