An algorithm is the heart of every search engine. Every efficient algorithm follows a set of instructions to solve a problem. In computer science, an algorithm must be optimized for speed. When we discuss an algorithm, we often analyze its complexity. A well-designed algorithm can process millions of entries. Learning an algorithm is essential for every developer. If your algorithm is slow, your search engine will fail. This algorithm focuses on high-frequency keyword matching.
